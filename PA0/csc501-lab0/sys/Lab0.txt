1) The rough layout of XINU memory stack is as follows

	
	
			



top of stack	before entering func	->0x00ffeff4
(stack grows	after entering func	->0x00ffefec
  down)		unallocated
		memory



		end   			->0x00028618
		edata 			->0x0001ea93
		etext 			->0x000194ed
		mem start		->0x00000000

2)The diffrence in stack top address before and after calling printtos() is 2 bytes.

		before entering func	->0x00ffeff4

							Parameters of printtos(None in this case)
top of stack						Return Address(address of main())

		after entering func	->0x00ffefec	Locals of printtos(long esp, long ebp)

3)No all the local variables are not dislayed. I think because it is stored in virtual memory.
